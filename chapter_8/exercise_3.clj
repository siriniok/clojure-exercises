;;;; In Chapter 5 you created a series of functions (c-int, c-str, c-dex) to read
;;;; an RPG character’s attributes. Write a macro that defines an arbitrary number
;;;; of attribute-retrieving functions using one macro call. Here’s how you would call it:
;;;;
;;;; (defattrs c-int :intelligence
;;;;           c-str :strength
;;;;           c-dex :dexterity)
