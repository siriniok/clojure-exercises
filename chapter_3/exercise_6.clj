;;;; Create a function that generalizes symmetrize-body-parts and
;;;; the function you created in Exercise 5. The new function should take
;;;; a collection of body parts and the number of matching body parts to add.
;;;; If you’re completely new to Lisp languages and functional programming,
;;;; it probably won’t be obvious how to do this. If you get stuck, just move
;;;; on to the next chapter and revisit the problem later.
